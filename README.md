Project focused on building and manipulating a Hamiltonian matrix
Just code was added, it needs armadillo library for linear algebra (diagonalization of matrix)

code includes:
-energy gap and specific heat calculations
-time evolution
-perturbation of matrix and spin structure factor calculations
-lanczos alghorithm for low energy approximations

Code was meant for me only so you won't understand much without my help because of half-polish functions names/comments and mess in code, BUT IT WORKS and I know how and why it works... yet
